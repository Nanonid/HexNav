# HexNav - Covering Earth with Hexagonal Map Tiles

Many strategy games use hexagonal tiles. One of the main advantages is that the
distance between the center of any tile and all its neighboring tiles is the
same.

We wonder if marrying a hexagonal tile system with the traditional geographic
system (longitude/latitude) will provide a better reasoning and visual
perception.

## How to Run

Go into HexNav directory, install depending Node modules by,

```
npm install
```

Now, you can start the HexNav app

```
node app.js
```

Navigate from the browser to http://localhost:8000 (default port 8000) to see the main page.

The data provided here include hospital-specific charges for the more than 3,000
U.S. hospitals that receive Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS)
payments for the top 100 most frequently billed discharges, paid under Medicare
