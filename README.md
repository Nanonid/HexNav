# HexNav - Covering Earth with Hexagonal Map Tiles

Many strategy games use hexagonal tiles. One of the main advantages is that the
distance between the center of any tile and all its neighboring tiles is the
same.

We wonder if marrying a hexagonal tile system with the traditional geographic
system (longitude/latitude) will provide a better reasoning and visual
perception.

## How to Run

Go into HexNav directory, install depending Node modules by,

```
npm install
```

Now, you can start the HexNav app

```
node app.js
```
